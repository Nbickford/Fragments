Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.7 since the previous release 0.6:

Build changes:

 - Support 64-bit builds on OS/X (using CoreAudio instead of
   obsolete QuickTime audio file reader)

 - Simplify RDF reading and fix some bugs. Now requires Dataquay
   (http://breakfastquay.com/dataquay/) rather than using Redland
   directly. Release builds use Sord/Serd rather than Redland

Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.6 since the previous release 0.5:

Build changes:

 - Switch to modular SV-libraries build using svcore library
 - We now require Vamp plugin SDK v2.3
 - Add autoconf configure script

Front-end changes:

 - Pick up default sample rate and channel count from the first
 audio file, where not specified in the transform, instead of using
 hard coded defaults
 - Make it possible to specify the window shape in transform
 - Fix the --csv-one-file option which did not work in 0.5
 - Fix --force option when using playlists
 - Add -v option to print version number and exit

Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.5 since the previous release 0.4:

Build changes:

 - Remove unused audioio library and avoid its dependencies

Front-end changes:

 - Avoid leaking file descriptors on exceptions
 - Fix embarrassing bug that caused failure to mix down to mono
 properly for single-channel plugins with multi-channel input files
 - Fail sooner if the output file is not writable (i.e. don't wait
 until the first data is available for writing)

Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.4 since the previous release 0.3:

Build changes:

 - Sonic Annotator now requires the Vamp plugin SDK v2.1 or newer.

Front-end changes:

 - Frequency-domain plugins now use the PluginInputDomainAdapter's new
 ShiftData processing method, ensuring that the first block received
 by the plugin is the one centred on 0 rather than starting at 0.
 Unfortunately, the old behaviour omitted a timing compensation step,
 and this fix actually changes the results from some plugin processes:
 the previous behaviour was not always in line with the Vamp plugin
 specification.

 - More useful diagnostics are now available when a plugin fails to
 load or run.

CSV back-end (feature writer) changes:

 - The CSV writer now closes its output files properly when it
 finishes writing to each one, rather than leaving them all open
 until the end and risk running out of file descriptors.  This was
 already the behaviour of the RDF writer, the CSV one has just been
 updated to match it.
 - The behaviour of the CSV writer has also been changed to match
 that of the RDF writer in handling file write failures (it now
 continues processing only if --force is given).


Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.3 since the previous release 0.2:

Front-end changes:

 - A new --force front-end option (distinct from the --csv-force and
 --rdf-force back-end options) has been added, which makes Sonic
 Annotator continue to process subsequent audio files instead of
 exiting after an error, if multiple audio files have been specified.

RDF back-end (feature writer) changes:

 - The RDF writer now conforms more correctly with the Music Ontology
 in the way it relates signal, track, and track metadata.  Signals
 that have available metadata now gain a Track resource to associate
 that metadata with, instead of hanging it directly from the Signal
 resource; also the audio file now encodes the signal rather than the
 signal being available as the audio file (matching the domain
 specification of the Music Ontology).  Note that this new resource
 structure will not be properly read by versions of Sonic Visualiser
 prior to 1.6 (should importing the data into Sonic Visualiser be of
 interest to you).

 - The --rdf-signal-uri option has been removed and replaced with the
 more meaningful set of options --rdf-audiofile-uri, --rdf-track-uri,
 and --rdf-maker-uri.

 - A new --rdf-network option is available, to cause Sonic Annotator
 to try to retrieve RDF descriptions for plugins from the network
 where those descriptions are not available locally.  Use of this
 option is recommended, but it is not the default because of the
 possible performance implication (even though the results are mostly
 cached, there may be some network access involved).

 - The RDF writer now writes the computed_by property for signal
 features.

 - Plugin and output URIs in the resulting RDF are now percent-encoded.
