Q: When can I get analytical for my own DJing kit?
A: Soon - maybe.
    As DJs, we strive to handcraft our tracks. Mixtapes, for instance, are more often than not extremely personal expressions. But what happens if a machine can DJ as well as one who has devoted their life to the art?
    analytical is a challenge: Can you be more creative than a machine? Don't just layer songs; weave them. Be Daniel Kim. Be DJ Earworm. Be something that a machine cannot replace. Be human.
