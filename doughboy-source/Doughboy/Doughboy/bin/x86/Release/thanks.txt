Thanks to Yuji Oshimoto for designing the 04B-03 font, which is used a few times throughout the game (for example, the options menu)
See his website at www.04.jp.org (we got the font from http://www.dsg4.com/04/extra/bitmap/index.html)













































































































































































































































Oh, and thank you for playing!
